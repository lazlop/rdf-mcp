LBNL_001,,"Identify each entity that is a zone, and either has a directly associated property or is indirectly connected to a property via a RoomDomainSpace through a chain of connections.",lbl/cborg-coder,Vocabulary Hallucination,"The generated query references `r223:RoomDomainSpace` as a class, but the ground‑truth query shows the correct class resides in the example namespace (`ex1:RoomDomainSpace`). The term `r223:RoomDomainSpace` does not exist in the standard223 ontology, indicating an invented vocabulary term. Additionally, the query uses a long list of connection predicates (`r223:connected`, `r223:connectedTo`, `r223:connectedFrom`, `r223:connectsThrough`, `r223:connectsAt`, `r223:connectsFrom`, `r223:connectsTo`) that are not defined in the standard, further evidencing vocabulary hallucination.",
LBNL_001,,"For each zone (target), what are the related non-writable property labels and ALC and MPC endpoint references?",lbl/cborg-coder,Vocabulary Hallucination,"The generated query invents Brick‑specific terms that do not exist in the target dataset: it uses `brick:Zone`, `brick:writable false`, `brick:hasALCEndpoint` and `brick:hasMPCEndpoint`. The ground‑truth query relies on the s223 and ref vocabularies (`s223:Zone`, `s223:Property`, `ref:endpoint`, `ref:mpc_db_name`, `ref:writable ""False""`). These mismatched predicates and classes show the model fabricated ontology terms rather than using the correct ones.",Topological Mismatch
LBNL_001,,"For each Zone that either has a Property directly or has a RoomDomainSpace reached by two connected steps and a contains relationship leading to a Property, what is the label of that Property and what are the external reference alc endpoint and mpc endpoint when writable is False?",lbl/cborg-coder,Topological Mismatch,"The generated query attempts to traverse exactly two 'ashrae:connected' edges using the unsupported SPARQL repetition syntax `(ashrae:connected){2}` and then directly accesses the Property via `ashrae:contains`. The ground‑truth query expresses the indirect path as `ashrae:connected/ashrae:connected/ashrae:contains/ashrae:hasProperty`, i.e., a three‑step chain that includes a `hasProperty` relationship after the `contains`. The generated pattern both mis‑represents the topology (omits the `hasProperty` step) and uses a syntactically invalid way to denote two hops, leading to a mismatch with the actual graph structure.",
LBNL_001,,"Which properties associated with building zones (including those linked through room domain spaces and chained connections) are read-only, and what are their labels together with the alc and mpc endpoints in their external references?",lbl/cborg-coder,Topological Mismatch,"The generated query uses a generic property path `{ ?zone (ash:connectedThrough|ash:connectedTo|ash:connectedFrom|ash:connectsThrough|ash:connectsFrom|ash:connectsTo|ash:connectsAt|ash:cnx)* ?property . ?property a ash:Property . }` which assumes a property can be reached directly via any sequence of connection predicates. The ground‑truth query shows that properties are linked through a specific `ash:hasProperty` edge (e.g., `?zone ash:hasProperty ?prop` or via `... ash:connected/... ash:contains/... ash:hasProperty ?prop`). Thus the generated query mismatches the actual graph topology, leading to no results. ",
LBNL_001,,List the labels of all non-writable properties for zones and show the corresponding alc endpoint and mpc database endpoint for each.,lbl/cborg-coder,Topological Mismatch,"The generated query assumes that a Zone directly has its properties via the triple `?zone std223:hasProperty ?prop`. The ground‑truth query shows that many zone properties are reached indirectly through a DomainSpace chain (e.g., `?zone s223:hasDomainSpace ?space . ?space ... s223:hasProperty ?prop`). By omitting this indirect path the model misses a large portion of relevant properties, indicating a mismatch in graph topology.",
LBNL_001,,What alc and mpc endpoints are defined for the read-only properties of each zone?,lbl/cborg-coder,Vocabulary Hallucination,"The generated query uses non‑existent Brick predicates: `https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick/endpoint` instead of the correct `brick:hasEndpoint`, `https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick/mpc_db_name` instead of `brick:hasMpcDbName`, and `https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick/writable` instead of `brick:writable`. These IRIs are not defined in the Brick ontology, leading to zero results.",
LBNL_001,,How can I find the alc and mpc endpoints for zone properties that aren't editable?,lbl/cborg-coder,Vocabulary Hallucination,"The generated query uses a made‑up namespace and terms such as `ex:Zone`, `ex:ZoneProperty`, `ex:isEditable`, `ex:alcEndpoint`, and `ex:mpcEndpoint`. The ground‑truth query relies on the official s223 and Brick vocabularies (`s223:Zone`, `s223:hasProperty`, `s223:hasExternalReference`, `ref:endpoint`, `ref:mpc_db_name`, `ref:writable`). The model substituted the correct ontology terms with invented ones, indicating a vocabulary hallucination.",
LBNL_002,,"Identify each entity that is an AHU, and either has a directly associated property or is indirectly connected to a property via a connectable.",lbl/cborg-coder,Topological Mismatch,"The generated query assumes a direct `s223:hasConnectionPoint` relationship from an AHU to a connectable and then `s223:hasProperty` on that connectable. The ground‑truth query reaches a connectable via `s223:contains` and then uses either `s223:observes` or `s223:hasProperty` to obtain the property. Hence the model selected an incorrect topology (direct hasConnectionPoint) and omitted the alternative `observes` path, resulting in a graph traversal that does not match the actual schema used in the dataset.",
LBNL_002,,"For each Air Handling Unit (AHU) whose label includes 'RTU', what are the related non-writable property labels and ALC and MPC endpoint references?",lbl/cborg-coder,Topological Mismatch,"The generated query directly uses `?ahu <http://data.ashrae.org/standard223#hasProperty> ?prop` to reach properties, but the ground truth shows properties are accessed via an intermediate connectable (e.g., `?target s223:contains ?connectable` then `(s223:observes | s223:hasProperty) ?prop`) or via a UNION with direct `s223:hasProperty`. This mismatch in graph topology causes the query to miss required hops and return no rows.",
LBNL_002,,"For each air handling unit whose label contains rtu, identify any connectable element it contains that observes or has property a property, or any property it has directly, and for each property give its label along with the ALC endpoint and the MPC database name from its external reference",lbl/cborg-coder,Misunderstanding User Intent,"The generated query binds an empty string to ?connectableLabel for direct AHU properties (BIND("""" AS ?connectableLabel)), resulting in no label for those rows, whereas the expected behavior is to use the AHU's label (or otherwise indicate the property belongs to the AHU). This shows the model mis‑interpreted the requirement to provide a meaningful label for direct properties. Additionally, the query does not collapse the two property patterns into a single path expression nor use DISTINCT, leading to duplicate rows, further indicating a mismatch between the user's intent and the produced query.",
LBNL_002,,"For RTU air handling units, what are the property names and their associated ALC and MPC endpoints defined in the external references",lbl/cborg-coder,Vocabulary Hallucination,"The generated query uses the predicates `brick:source` and `brick:mpc_db_name` on the ExternalReference node. In the ground‑truth query the correct Brick predicates are `ref:endpoint` (for the ALC endpoint) and `ref:mpc_db_name`. `brick:source` is not a defined term in the Brick schema, indicating the model invented an incorrect vocabulary term. This mismatch causes the query to reference a non‑existent property and therefore deviates from the intended semantics.",
LBNL_002,,"Which RTU units expose properties with external endpoints, and what are the property labels along with those ALC and MPC endpoint addresses",lbl/cborg-coder,Vocabulary Hallucination,"The generated query uses IRIs such as <https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick/endpoint> and <https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick/mpc_db_name>, which are not valid Brick terms (the correct IRIs include a hash, e.g., https://brickschema.org/schema/Brick#endpoint). This mismatch prevents any matches against the dataset.
Additionally, the query does not include the Brick prefix declaration, further indicating invented vocabulary.
These incorrect predicates are the main reason the query returns no results.",Topological Mismatch
LBNL_002,,Where can I find the nonwritable external ALC and MPC endpoints for properties on each RTU air handling unit,lbl/cborg-coder,Vocabulary Hallucination,"The generated query uses Brick-specific predicates (brick:writable, brick:endpoint, brick:mpc_db_name) even though the dataset follows the ASHRAE‑223 ontology. The ground‑truth query uses std:writable, std:hasEndpoint (or ref:endpoint), and std:hasMPCDBName. This indicates the model invented or incorrectly borrowed vocabulary from the wrong ontology.",Topological Mismatch
LBNL_002,,What read-only control endpoints are available for properties of RTU units,lbl/cborg-coder,Topological Mismatch,"The generated query follows a simple RTU → brick:hasPoint → brick:Control_Point → brick:writable path, but the ground truth accesses RTU units via s223:contains or s223:hasProperty to s223:Property, then uses s223:hasExternalReference to obtain endpoint URIs. This mismatch in graph traversal shows the model assumed an incorrect topology for locating read‑only control endpoints.",Misunderstanding User Intent
LBNL_003,,Get reheat ARU data (for UFT reheat) by identifying each entity that is a Water-to-Water Heat Pump and contains a property that observes a non-writable quantity with reference endpoints.,lbl/cborg-coder,Vocabulary Hallucination,"The generated query uses ontology terms that do not match the target schema. It declares the pump class as `s223:WaterToWaterHeatPump` (the correct class in the ground‑truth is `s223:WatertoWaterHeatPump`). It also uses predicates such as `s223:hasProperty`, `s223:ObservableProperty`, `s223:WritableQuantity`, and reference predicates `s223:hasExternalReference` / `s223:hasReferenceEndpoint` which are not present in the Brick‑linked schema used in the ground‑truth (which relies on `ref:endpoint`, `ref:mpc_db_name`, `ref:writable`). These invented or misstated terms indicate a vocabulary hallucination rather than a misunderstanding of intent or topology.",
LBNL_003,,"For each Water-to-Water Heat Pump, what are the related property labels and non-writable quantities' ALC and MPC endpoint references?",lbl/cborg-coder,Vocabulary Hallucination,"The generated query uses Brick predicates that do not exist for the requested information: `brick:endpoint` and `brick:mpc_db_name`. The ground‑truth query (and Brick schema) require the predicates `brick:hasALC` and `brick:hasMPC` (or via an external reference entity). Additionally, the query incorrectly links a pump to a property with `std223:hasProperty` whereas the correct topology is `pump s223:contains property` followed by `property s223:observes quantity` and then `quantity s223:hasExternalReference`. These invented or mis‑named terms indicate a vocabulary hallucination.

LBNL_003,,"For each water-to-water heat pump, what property does it contain, what is the label of that property, which quantity does it observe, and what are the ALC endpoint and MPC database name of its non-writable external reference?",lbl/cborg-coder,Misunderstanding User Intent,"The generated SPARQL query is just the string `nan`, which is not a valid query and does not attempt to retrieve any of the requested information. The model responded with unrelated tool calls (get_building_summary) and a corrective suggestion rather than producing the required SELECT query, indicating it failed to understand that the immediate task was to output a concrete SPARQL query matching the user's request.",
LBNL_003,,"Which internal properties of water-to-water heat pumps observe specific quantities via non-writable external references, and what are those references’ ALC endpoints and MPC database names along with the property labels?",lbl/cborg-coder,ERROR,Received empty model response,
LBNL_003,,What non-writable external endpoints and MPC database names are associated with measurements taken by components inside water-to-water heat pumps?,lbl/cborg-coder,Topological Mismatch,"The generated query links a component directly to an endpoint with `?component brick:endpoint ?endpoint` and then fetches the MPC name via `?endpoint brick:mpc_db_name ?mpcName`. In the correct query the endpoint is reached through an intermediate external reference: the component observes a property (`?prop s223:observes ?qty`), the property has an external reference (`?qty s223:hasExternalReference ?ref`), and the reference provides both the endpoint and the MPC DB name (`?ref ref:endpoint ?alc_endpoint . ?ref ref:mpc_db_name ?mpc_endpoint`). This incorrect assumption of a direct relationship constitutes a topological mismatch.",
